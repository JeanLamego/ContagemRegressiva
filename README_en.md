## 📜 Technologies

I created the countdown timer using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the goal of recreating the popular countdown apps that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. I aimed to optimize it as much as possible, with future enhancements such as automated background changes based on the user's event name and saving the countdown in the browser cache.
